20151021:
    freezepoint name: V0.9
    branch name: HEAD
    Deployed where: 16WW (released copy on GitHub https://github.com/DamonHD/OTRadioLink V0.8).
    Changes since last freezepoint (developer/mgr initials and brief description):
    Previous significant freezepoint: V0.8
    DHD20150817: issues still pending: TX level control, support for multiple channels, RX filter signature.
    DHD20150820: starting V0.9...
    DHD20150821: repo transferred from DamonHD to OpenTRV a/cs on GitHub.
